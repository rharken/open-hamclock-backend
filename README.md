## Vision
The goal is to make this as a drop-in replacement for the HamClock backend by replicating the same client/server responses with Perl CGI scripting and static files. We don't have access to the backend server source code so this is completely created by looking at the interfaces. The goal is to allow for local or central install of OHB to keep all existing HamClock's from working beyond June 2026

## Interoperability
This project generates map and data artifacts in the same formats expected by the HamClock client (e.g. zlib compressed BMP RGB565 map tiles) to support interoperability. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original HamClock project or any third party. Data products are derived from public upstream sources such as NOAA SWPC and NASA

## In Work
- maps/Aurora
Status: In Progress. We made progress by developing a script to create the base layer and have an Aurora producing script. However, we have not produced all the base layer maps to be able to support all Aurora map sizes. Only Night has been proven to be working so far at 660x330

## Known Issues
[Active Issues](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/issues)

- Satellite planning page will cause HamClock to fail. Error message refers to a SatTool name lookup issue. This seems to only happen if two satellites are not selected by the user. To the best of our knowledge, this is a HamClock bug
- IP Geolocation will not work if API key not set. To fix, set API key in fetchIPGeoloc.pl
- Root directories missing on install. Manually create cache, tmp, tmp/psk-cache, and logs if missing
- One or more SDO images may report 'File is not BMP'. If this is the case, try switching to a different image temporarily
- Invalid data may display and it can take time for the backend to build up a suitable cache
  - Running the server data sync script will pull down the latest aurora and DRAP stats.txt file from an active HamClock server (Currently ClearSkyInstitute):
    - /opt/hamclock-backend/scripts/sync_server_data_files.sh
  
# Importance of Accurate and Consistent Time
This is worth documenting explicitly. Your backend now depends on monotonic, synchronized time. Without it, feeds appear “broken” even when structurally correct.

Below is a clean, technical README section you can drop into OHB.

Time Synchronization Requirements

Open HamClock Backend (OHB) and all HamClock clients must maintain accurate and synchronized system time.

OHB generates time-series data (aurora, solar wind, DRAP, SSN, etc.) using Unix epoch timestamps. HamClock clients compute data age using:

age = now_client - epoch_from_backend


If the client clock is incorrect or significantly out of sync with the backend, HamClock will discard valid data and log errors such as:

AURORA: skipping age -491926 hrs
AURORA: only 0 points


Negative ages indicate the client believes the data is from the future.

Required Conditions

• Backend system clock must be accurate (UTC).
• HamClock client clock must be accurate (UTC).
• Clock skew between backend and clients should be less than a few seconds.

Even multi-minute skew can distort plotted slopes.
Large skew (hours/days/years) will cause complete data rejection.

Enabling Time Sync (Linux / Raspberry Pi)

Verify status:

timedatectl


Enable NTP synchronization:

sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd


If systemd-timesyncd is not available:

sudo apt install ntp
sudo systemctl enable ntp
sudo systemctl start ntp


Confirm synchronization:

timedatectl


You should see:

System clock synchronized: yes

Why This Matters

OHB uses deterministic epoch flooring (30-minute cadence).
HamClock assumes evenly spaced historical bins.

Time drift breaks these assumptions.

Symptoms of clock problems include:

• Aurora graph shows no data
• “skipping age” messages
• Flatlined plots
• Sudden apparent time gaps

These are almost always clock skew issues — not backend failures.

Operational Recommendation

In production environments:

• Enable NTP on all systems
• Monitor time sync status
• Avoid manual time changes
• Avoid running systems without network time for extended periods

OHB does not compensate for client clock drift by design.
## Compatibility
- [x] Ubuntu 22.x LTS (Baremetal, VM, or WSL)
- [x] Ubuntu 24 AWS AMI (Baremetal, VM, or WSL)
- [x] Debian 13.3 
- [x] Raspberry Pi 3b+, 4, and 5
     - [x] Tested Trixie 64 bit OS on Pi 3b+ with image sizes 660x330, 1320x660
           - 2640x1320 for MUF-RT does not currently work
- [x] Inovato Quadra
- [ ] Mac 

## Install:
(NOTE: to run OHB in docker, visit https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/docker/README.md)

```bash
   # Confirmed working in aws t3-micro Ubuntu 24.x LTS instance
   wget -O install_ohb.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/refs/heads/main/aws/install_ohb.sh
   chmod +x install_ohb.sh
   sudo ./install_ohb.sh
```
## Selecting map image sizes during install

By default, OHB generates the full HamClock size set. This is only recommend on a high end PC or VM:

`660x330,1320x660,1980x990,2640x1320,3960x1980,5280x2640,5940x2970,7920x3960`

To install with a custom size set, pass one of the options below:

### Option A: Comma-separated list
> [!WARNING]
> Attempting to image generate multiple sizes or 4K UHD sizes on Pi3B can cause it to overheat!

```bash
chmod +x ./install_ohb.sh
sudo ./install_ohb.sh --sizes "660x330,1320x660,1980x990"
```
### Option B: Repeat --size
> [!WARNING]
> Attempting to image generate multiple sizes or 4K UHD sizes on Pi3B can cause it to overheat!

```bash
chmod +x ./install_ohb.sh
sudo ./install_ohb.sh --size 660x330 --size 1320x660 --size 1980x990
```

Install script will store configuration under /opt/hamclock-backend/etc/ohb-sizes.conf

```bash
# Canonical default list (keep in sync with HamClock)
DEFAULT_SIZES=( \
  "660x330" \
  "1320x660" \
  "1980x990" \
  "2640x1320" \
  "3960x1980" \
  "5280x2640" \
  "5940x2970" \
  "7920x3960" \
)
```

Note: OHB will install default maps (Countries and Terrain) for all possible sizes. This does not incur any major CPU or RAM hit on small form factor PCs as it is just a download, extract and install

After install, update your HamClock startup script to point to OHB. Then, reboot your HamClock.

## Starting HamClock with OHB Local Install
HamClock is hard-coded to use the clearskyinstitute.com URL. You can override to use a new backend by starting HamClock with the -b option

### Localhost (if running OHB adjacent to your existing HamClock client such as Raspberry Pi)
```bash
hamclock -b localhost:80
```
Note: Depending on where you installed HamClock application, the path may be different. If you followed the instructions [here](https://qso365.co.uk/2024/05/how-to-set-up-a-hamclock-for-your-shack/), then it will be installed in /usr/local/bin.

### Starting HamClock with OHB Central Install
```bash
hamclock -b \<central-server-ip-or-host\>:80
```
## Stopping OHB
### Web Server
```bash
sudo systemctl stop lighttpd
```
### Cron Jobs
#### Remove all jobs
```bash
sudo crontab -u www-data -l > ~/www-data.cron.backup
sudo crontab -u www-data -r
```
Note: Removing the cron jobs will stop all future background processes, not currently running. Ensure that the www-data.cron.backup actually was created before you remove all of www-data user's cronjobs

#### Restore all jobs
```bash
sudo crontab -u www-data /path/to/www-data.cron.backup
sudo crontab -u www-data -l | head
```

## Enabling OHB Dashboard
To enable OHB dashboard, it is a manual install while it is being developed. 

```bash
 sudo cp /opt/hamclock-backend/lighttpd-conf/51-ohb-dashboard.conf /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/
 sudo lighttpd -t -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
 sudo service lighttpd force-reload
 sudo -u www-data cp /opt/hamclock-backend/ham/dashboard/* /opt/hamclock-backend/htdocs
```
Ensure all scripts are owned by www-data under /opt/hamclock-backend/htdocs

## Project Completion Status

HamClock requests about 40+ artifacts. I have locally replicated all of them that I could find.
