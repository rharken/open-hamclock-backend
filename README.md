# open-hamclock-backend
Open Source and Faithful HamClock Backend Replacement. This is a community project and no relation to the creator of HamClock Elwood Downey, WB0OEW, ecdowney@clearskyinstitute.com SK

I wish the Downey family my deepest condolences.

This is a WIP.

# Interoperability
This project generates map and data artifacts in the same formats expected by the HamClock client (e.g. zlib compressed BMP RGB565 map tiles) to support interoperability. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original HamClock project or any third party. Data products are derived from public upstream sources such as NOAA SWPC and NASA

# Project Completion Status

HamClock requests about 40+ artifacts. I have locally replicated all of them that I could find.

# Images
- SDO/f_304_170.bmp.z : This is a zlib compressed bitmap. It comes from here most likely: https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/images/latest.html and https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/images/latest_aia_304.gif
- maps/Clouds : ftp://public.sos.noaa.gov/rt/sat/linear/raw/
  
Decompressing the images for viewing can be done using $ zlib-flate -uncompress < filename.bmp.z > newfilename.bmp

Images with N means Night and D means Day

# Vision
The goal is to make this as a drop-in replacement for the HamClock backend by replicating the same client/server responses with Perl CGI scripting and static files. We don't have access to the backend server source code so this is completely created by looking at the interfaces. To allow existing HamClock's running on Arduino to continue to work, we will setup a local DNS sinkhole to redirect to your local backend running at your home or office.

# Requirements:
- perl
- lighttpd (or apache httpd with CGI enabled)
- perl-libwww-perl
- perl-JSON
- perl-XML-RSS
- perl-XML-Feed
- perl-HTML-Parser
- VOACAPL: https://www.qsl.net/hz1jw/voacapl/index.html
- ImageMagick
- numpy

### Prerequisites

This backend is designed to be lightweight and portable. It relies on a standard web server with CGI support and a small set of Perl modules.

You will need:

- Perl 5.10 or newer
- `lighttpd` (recommended) or Apache httpd with CGI enabled
- Cron (for scheduled data generation)
  
# Install:
```bash
  apt install lighttpd libwww-perl libjson-perl libxml-rss-perl libxml-feed-perl libhtml-parser-perl
  
  sudo tar xzf hamclock-backend.tar.gz -C /opt
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/hamclock-backend
  sudo chmod +x /opt/hamclock-backend/htdocs/ham/HamClock/*.pl
  sudo cp 50-hamclock.conf /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/50-hamclock.conf

  # Update the server modules inside your lighttpd configuration file located at: /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  # Only change should be the "mod_cgi" module at the end:
      server.modules = (
          "mod_indexfile",
          "mod_access",
          "mod_alias",
          "mod_redirect",
          "mod_cgi",
      )

  sudo lighttpd -tt -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  sudo lighttpd-enable-mod hamclock
  sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
  # add crontab as user www-data and described in scripts/crontab
```
